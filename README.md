## About The Project

FusionConnect is a social-community based DeFi Dapp wherein users who are a part of the community can look up various details about other users in the community and leverage this knowledge to make better informed decisions in the space of defi trading.

Key Features:

* A user who is a part of the community , can view other user's transaction history , portfolio , followers and followings (across various platforms such as lens protocol xmtp farcaster) thanks to Airstack API's :) 
* The user can then decide to copy the swap transactions of a particular wallet address / lens id and perform them at the best possible rate using the 1inch fusion swap API :)

These features foster a community-experience that is conducive for beginners and experts in the DeFi field alike !
